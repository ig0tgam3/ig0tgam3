- 👋 Hi, I’m @ig0tgam3 because igotgame was taken
- 👀 I’m interested in the connections with python and gpt
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with gpt to learn how to create a personal gpt way of gleaning information 
- 📫 How to reach me for now right here somehow if I ever figure it out
